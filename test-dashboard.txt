The dashboard is experiencing a server-side error. Based on the investigation:

1. ✅ JWT Login is WORKING - users can log in and JWT tokens are created
2. ✅ Authentication redirect is WORKING - unauthenticated users are redirected to /login
3. ❌ Dashboard data fetching is FAILING - there's a server-side error when rendering the page

Possible causes:
1. Database query syntax issue (despite fixing FILTER -> CASE and adding COALESCE)
2. Edge Runtime limitation with complex queries
3. Missing data in the database causing unexpected NULL values
4. Component rendering issue (OrderStatusGrid, DepositBonusBanner, or TutorialSection)

Since I cannot access Cloudflare server logs, I recommend:
1. Check Cloudflare Pages Functions logs in the dashboard
2. Add try-catch blocks around each database query
3. Test with a simplified dashboard page first
4. Check if the D1 database has the necessary tables and data

The JWT authentication system itself is fully functional.
